# MinecraftPlugins
TiaEssientials:
  a collection of basic commands adjusted for my own needs and sometimes vanilla commands just made easier to write

cbTeleport:
  the purpose of this plugin is to connect worlds on the bottom and/or the top of the world.
  when a player reaches a certain height he gets teleported to the connected world on the same x/z coordinate
  or like in the nether with a multiplicator

Explorer2:
  this plugin was for exploring the world, but since I found a simple program that did this job faster,
  it isn't needed anymore
  
all projectes noted above are made for CraftBukkit that was discontinued due to a DMCA, I might port them over to Sponge in the future.
